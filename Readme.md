# BUGGER
(***B**ig **U**gly **G**etter **G**adget for **E**lucidating **R**esults*)

------------------------
I got sick of waiting for my University of Canterbury Exam results, so this does the waiting for you. Waits for and retreives exam results when they become avalible. It does this by checking the results page every 5mins (configurable).

#### Installing

git clone https://github.com/mrkno/bugger.git Bugger

#### The Code
- Is it ugly? Yes.
- Does it work? Probably not now.
- Do I care? Better question: how much chocolate will you send me?
- Does the university support the grotesque reverse engineering of their SSO? I doubt it.
- Tests? Written in 5 mins and tested in production. It Worked™!
- License? MIT.
